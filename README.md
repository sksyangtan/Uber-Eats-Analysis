# Uber Eats Delivery Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes Uber Eats delivery data to understand delivery performance, order trends, and operational efficiency.  
The analysis focuses on identifying **delivery time patterns, demand behavior, and potential bottlenecks**, demonstrating practical data analysis skills relevant to Data Analyst roles.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Analyze **delivery time distribution**
- Identify factors contributing to **delayed deliveries**
- Understand **order volume trends**
- Generate insights to improve **customer satisfaction and operational efficiency**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
- Source: Uber Eats delivery dataset (`4106302-uber-eats-deliveries.csv`)
- Records: Thousands of delivery orders
- Key columns include:
  - Order ID
  - Delivery Time
  - Order Status
  - Distance
  - Location Type (Urban / Semi-Urban / Metropolitan)

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Delivery time distribution analysis
- Comparison of delivery performance across location types
- Identification of peak delivery duration ranges
- Trend analysis to detect operational inefficiencies

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most deliveries are completed within the **15–30 minute range**, indicating efficient baseline operations.
- A smaller but impactful portion of deliveries exceeds **30 minutes**, which may negatively affect customer satisfaction.
- Semi-urban areas show **longer average delivery times**, likely due to distance and availability of delivery partners.
- Delivery delays tend to cluster during high-demand periods.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Optimize delivery radius and routing strategies for semi-urban areas.
- Improve delivery partner allocation during peak hours.
- Provide **transparent delivery time estimates** to customers before checkout.
- Use delay patterns to proactively adjust operational planning.

---

## 📈 Relevance for Data Analyst Roles
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Clean and analyze real-world operational data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build clear, meaningful visualizations
- Translate data findings into **business-focused insights**
- Support decision-making with evidence-based recommendations
